# PenTestTools
some tools for penetration testing/general auditing
or another way to say this is redundant shiz being semi-automated to save more time for other things like:
  1. long walks on the beach
  2. spending time with friends and family
  3. magical bike rides
  4. declaring Estonia a rouge state
  5. stapling things to other unrelated things
  6. pretending to be a mountain lion
  7. YOLOing your life's savings on SPY PUTS
  8. being left by my wife for financial irresponsibility 
  9. sliding the strings in unnattended shoes so that one shoe string is longer than the other by like 3 inches
