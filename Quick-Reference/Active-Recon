>HOST:
YOU CAN USE 
host www.website.com
TO RESOLVE A HOSTNAME TO IT'S IP ADDRESS, YOU CAN ALSO USE
host -t
TO DETERMINE A TYPE OF RECORD TO RESOLVE, I.E.
host -t mx website.com
FOR MAIL RECORDS, OR
host -t txt website.com
FOR DESCRIPTIVE TEXT RECORDS, OR
mail.website.com
TO SPECIFICALLY QUERY A SUBDOMAIN FOR LOOKUP
FORWARD LOOKUP BRUTE FORCE:
YOU CAN ALSO UE A BIT OF BASH SCRIPTING TO AUTOMATE LOOKUPS, I.E.
1. MAKE A list.txt FILE:
www
ftp
mail
drive
owa
router
proxy
admin
2. WRITE A BASH SCRIPT THAT DENOTES EACH LINE AS A VARIABLE AND RUNS THE LOOKUP
for ip in $(cat list.txt); do host $ip.website.com; done
OR IF THEY ALL APPEAR TO BE IN A SPECIFIC IP BLOCK FOR EXAMPLE 10.1.1.1-100 YOU MAY WANT TO TRY
for ip in $(seq 1 100); do host 10.1.1.$ip; done | grep -v "not found"

>DNS ZONE TRANSFERS:

IF WE ARE ABLE TO LOCATE ANY NAMESERVERS, IT WOULD BE BEST TO TRY TO PERFORM A ZONE TRANSFER, AS TO LEARN A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT ABOUT 
THE LAYOUT OF THE NETWORK HEIRARCHY, TO DO SO WE CAN USE THE HOST TOOL AS WELL
host -l website.com nameserver.website.com
IF WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE LOCATING NAME SERVERS ALWAY REMEMBER TO CHECK FOR THAT SPECIFIC RECORD TYPE I.E.
host -t ns website.com
