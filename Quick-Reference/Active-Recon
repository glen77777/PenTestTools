>HOST RESOLUTION:
YOU CAN USE 
host www.website.com
TO RESOLVE A HOSTNAME TO IT'S IP ADDRESS, YOU CAN ALSO USE
host -t
TO DETERMINE A TYPE OF RECORD TO RESOLVE, I.E.
host -t mx website.com
FOR MAIL RECORDS, OR
host -t txt website.com
FOR DESCRIPTIVE TEXT RECORDS, OR
mail.website.com
TO SPECIFICALLY QUERY A SUBDOMAIN FOR LOOKUP
FORWARD LOOKUP BRUTE FORCE:
YOU CAN ALSO UE A BIT OF BASH SCRIPTING TO AUTOMATE LOOKUPS, I.E.
1. MAKE A list.txt FILE:
www
ftp
mail
drive
owa
router
proxy
admin
2. WRITE A BASH SCRIPT THAT DENOTES EACH LINE AS A VARIABLE AND RUNS THE LOOKUP
for ip in $(cat list.txt); do host $ip.website.com; done
OR IF THEY ALL APPEAR TO BE IN A SPECIFIC IP BLOCK FOR EXAMPLE 10.1.1.1-100 YOU MAY WANT TO TRY
for ip in $(seq 1 100); do host 10.1.1.$ip; done | grep -v "not found"

>DNS ZONE TRANSFERS:

IF WE ARE ABLE TO LOCATE ANY NAMESERVERS, IT WOULD BE BEST TO TRY TO PERFORM A ZONE TRANSFER, AS TO LEARN A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT ABOUT 
THE LAYOUT OF THE NETWORK HEIRARCHY, TO DO SO WE CAN USE THE HOST TOOL AS WELL
host -l website.com nameserver.website.com
IF WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE LOCATING NAME SERVERS ALWAY REMEMBER TO CHECK FOR THAT SPECIFIC RECORD TYPE I.E.
host -t ns website.com

DNSRECON:
YOU CAN ALSO USE DNSRECON TO ATTEMPT A ZONETRANSFER BY RUNNING 
dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -t axfr
OR TO USE THE LIST FROM EARLIER TO PERFORM FORWARD BRUTES
dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -D ~/list.txt -t brt

DNSENUM:
DNSENUM ALSO DOES ZONETRANSFERS, TYPICAL USAGE WOULD BE
dnsenum website.com

>PORT SCANNING:
 NETCAT:
 TCP SCANNING
 nc -nvv -w 1 -z 10.1.1.1 1-5000
 -w SPECIFIES TIMEOUT, WHILE -z SPECIFIES ZERO I/O MODE TO AVOID TRYING TO CONNECT TO EACH PORT
 UDP SCANNING:
 nc -nv -u -z -w 1 10.1.1.1 1-5000
 -u DESIGNATES THE UDP PROTOCOL
 
 >ACCOUNTING FOR TRAFFIC:
 TO ACCOUNT FOR TRAFFIC GENERATED DOING SCANS YOU CAN USE
 sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -s IP.ADD.HE.RE -j ACCEPT
 sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d IP.ADD.HE.RE -j ACCEPT
 TO MAKE A RULE TO TRACK THE BANDWIDTH USED TO AND FROM AN IP, AND
 sudo iptables -z 
 TO ZERO THE COUNTERS
 
 >NMAP:
 TO RUN A DEFAULT 1000 PORT SCAN USE 
 nmap ip.add.he.re
 TO RUN A SCAN OF ALL PORTS USE
 nmap -p 1-65535 IP.ADD.HE.RE
 TO RUN A STEALTH SCAN 
 sudo nmap -sS IPP.ADD.HE.RE
 TO RUN A TCP CONNECT SCAN
 nmap -sT IPP.ADD.HE.RE
 TO RUN A UDP SCAN
 sudo nmap -sU IPP.ADD.HE.RE
 TO RUN UDP IN CONJUNCTION WITH TCP SYN
 sudo nmap -sS -sU IP.ADD.HE.RE
 
 TO PERFORM A NETWORK SWEEP
 nmap -sn IP.ADD.HE.RE-RE (10.11.1.1-254)
 NETWORK SWEEP TO GREPPABLE OUTPUT
 nmap -v -sn 10.11.1.1-254 -oG netsweep.txt
 grep Up netsweep.txt | cut -d " " -f 2
 
 PERFORM NET SWEEP FOR WEB SERVERS
 nmap -p 80,443 10.1.1.1-254 -oG websweep.txt
 grep open websweep.txt | cut -d " " -f2
 
 TOP PORTS SCAN
 nmap -sT -A --top-ports=100 10.1.1.1-254 -oG topports.txt
 
 FINGERPRINTING
 sudo nmap -sV -sT -A -O 10.11.1.220
